## Hello, I'm **DanTheDude**!

I create **[Minecraft Maps](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/danthedude/)** for **Java Edition**, often inspired by other video games.

I also create **[YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiMWeGliSAsDVsd6yYnxDkA)**, which usually revolves around whatever map I'll be making.

I'm also on **[Patreon](https://patreon.com/DanTheDude?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link)**, where I post exclusive content, such as **Bonus Maps**, **Behind-The-Scenes**, and even **Early Access** to upcoming maps.

If you want to get in touch, you can join my official **[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NzH2R6d2c9)**.
